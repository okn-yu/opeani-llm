The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 33.3 °F (0.7 °C). Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936. The city of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In 2021, the New York City Council banned the use of synthetic pesticides by city agencies and instead required organic lawn management.
